Hello! The code below computes the sum of all integers in the range `0..=100` (inclusive)

```
let sum = 0;
for x in 0..=100 {
    sum += x;
}
```

This is an imperative style of completing the task, but we can make it more functional

```
(0..=100)
    .iter()
    .sum()
```

I think the functional approach is nice and clean, but if we want to make this
run more efficiently we can replace it with the following.

```
100 * (100 + 1) / 2
```

This formula directly calculates the value without the need for iteration, isn't that nice :)
