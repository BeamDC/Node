# Node
a typesetting language

# Goals
- compile to a pdf (and maybe our own file format in the future)
- simple syntax so that I can write notes fast
- lots of flexibility and modularity to also allow for reduced complexity
- a system capable of fast compilation and rendering complex objects (graphs or smth)
